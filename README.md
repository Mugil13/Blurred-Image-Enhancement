# Image Deblurring with Convolutional Autoencoders

This project implements a deep learning-based image restoration model that removes blur from defocused images using convolutional autoencoders.

---

## Model Architecture

- **Encoder**: Multiple Conv2D layers to compress features  
- **Latent Space**: Bottleneck representation  
- **Decoder**: Conv2DTranspose layers to reconstruct the sharp image  
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- **Optimizer**: Adam

## Evaluation & Outputs

- Qualitative comparison: Input vs Ground Truth vs Predicted  
- Metrics: MSE, Accuracy (optional display)

## Dataset Structure

- `sharp/`: Directory containing sharp (clean) images  
- `defocused_blurred/`: Directory containing blurred images
