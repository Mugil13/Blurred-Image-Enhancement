# Blurred-Image-Enhancement
This project implements a convolutional autoencoder to restore blurred images using deep learning. The model is trained on a dataset of paired sharp (clean) and defocused (blurred) images. It learns to map blurry inputs to their sharp counterparts using a mean squared error loss.
